      <h1>INTERNSHALA CAREER SCHOLARSHIP FOR GIRLS</h1>
      <br>
      <p style="text-align: left;">Internshala Career Scholarship for Girls is an annual award of ₹25,000/- <br>
        intended to help advance one girl’s career in her chosen field. <br>
        Instituted in 2012, the scholarship commemorates the <br>
        tragic coincidence of Nirbhaya’s loss of life on the<br>
        same day as Internshala celebrates its anniversary. <br>
        The scholarship is meant to recognise a girl who has fought against <br>
        odds that restrained her from pursuing the career of her dreams<br>
        in any field (academics, sports, arts, etc.).<br>
        <br>
        The Internshala scholarship is strictly reserved for girls with a career objective:<br>
        <br>
          <ul>
            <li>The applicant must be a girl and an Indian National.</li>
            <li>Candidate must be of age 17 to 23 when applying for the scholarship.</li>
            <li>Applicant must be having a career objective and struggling to<br>
                achieve it due to various reasons</li>
        </ul>
